# Golden-age-of-video-games
This project analyzes critic and user ratings data, along with sales data, for the top 400 video games released since 1977. Our mission is to find a possible 'golden age' of video games, exploring the years when both critics and players were most satisfied. We will use data analysis skills, such as data set union and set theory, to achieve this.
